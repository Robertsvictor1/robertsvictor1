Description: Documenting a cybersecurity incident

Tool(s) NONE

The 5 W's 

Who: An organized group of unethical hackers.

What: A ransomware security incident.

Where:  U.S. health care clinic.

When:  Tuesday 9:00 a.m.

Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.

Additional notes:
I recommend that an employee training to train employees on how to prevent reoccurrence.
